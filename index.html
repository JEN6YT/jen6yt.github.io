                <p>Hi! I am Jennifer. I study
                    <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Engineering Science</a> at University of Toronto. 
                    During this program, I have learnt about various engineering disciplines, problem-solving techniques, and programming skills.
                    In addition, I have developed a strong interest in data science and machine learning, especially in the field of biologically plausible neural network, Natural Language Processing, and large foundation models.
                    I am also interested in the intersection of technology and social impact, such as using unlearning techniques to reduce model bias and enhance model privacy. 
                    I am passionate about using my skills to make a positive difference in the world.
                </p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities and exploring new technologies. If you would love to have a chat, feel free to shoot me an email! </p>
